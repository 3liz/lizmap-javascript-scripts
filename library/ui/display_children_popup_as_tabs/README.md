## Display children popup as tabs

* This script works with Lizmap >= 3.5.
* It displays all children popups as tabs next to parent popup tab.
* Children are defined in QGIS in 'Project Properties' => Relations.
* Children tabs are ordered by their Id so you can control it by setting Ids
as 0_your_id, 1_your_id, ... for example.
